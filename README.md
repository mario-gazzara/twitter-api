# Unofficial Twitter API

This project provides an unofficial API for interacting with Twitter.

I wanted to build a bot that could reply to tweets with a specific hashtag.

I found that the official Twitter API was too expensive for my use case, so I decided to build my own.

This project include only the wrapper for the Twitter API, and a few examples of how to use it, the bot I was building is not included.

After a few days of testing, I was permanently banned from Twitter. I believe this was due to the high volume of requests I was making to the Twitter API in a short period of time.

If you want to use this project, please use different proxies for each account you use, avoid making too many requests in a short period of time and try to not make a kind of pattern in your requests, because I think that's what got me banned.

I decided to open source this project because I was very mad when I got banned knowing that I was not doing anything wrong, and I think that Twitter should provide a better API for developers with a fair price.

Take it as a starting point for your own project, it's not absolutely complete, but it's a good start.

I hope this project can help you build your own Twitter bot, and I hope you have better luck than I did.
